 OpenSSL is an open-source toolkit that implements SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and 
 TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocols. This test profile makes use of the built-in
 "openssl speed" benchmarking capabilities. Using openssl speed (test library performance)
 command to evaluate the algo RSA4096 (how many sign/s and verify/s) and SHA256
 (how many bytes/s)

homepage: https://github.com/openssl/openssl

parameters:
 runtime:
 algo:          [sha256, rsa4096]

results:
 openssl-basic.KByte/s: KB/s
 openssl-basic.sign/s: sign/s
 openssl-basic.verify/s: verify/s
